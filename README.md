## Codility Training Exercises

Polishing up my Javascript skills, I decided to give [codility](https://codility.com/) a try. This is a collection of the optimal results I got from the lessons; I did fairly well, though did not really hit 100% the first time so I came back and tried to figured out what went wrong.

This is not a cheat sheet so don't use the codes in here yet until you tried to play around the lessons in their site. I documented them here merely as a reference for myself and hopefully to also save you some headache figuring out what's wrong with your codes.

Have fun coding!
